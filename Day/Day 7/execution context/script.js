3. getsum time is allocate memory and stores all the code
7. sum1 variable allocated to undefine
8. sum2 variable allocated to undefine

execution phase
1. take value of x and y
3 skip the funtion
7. invoke getsum and create a new function execution context
3. assinged value
4. calculation takes place
5. return function
8. open another execution context to solve same thing with different parameter.*/
